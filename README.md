# Steam URL Checker
## Usage
Build the application either using an IDE or via the command line.
For Visual Studio: 
> Select 'Release' configuration, then Build > Build Solution

For Command Line:
> `cd` into the root folder for the project,
> then run `dotnet build` 

In the same folder as the executable, create a text document called `strings.txt`. Into this file, you can then place the URLs you want to check, one per line.
Then either run the executable using `dotnet run` or simply double-click the executable.
